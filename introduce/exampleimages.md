## Images Captured by Dome Camera
Images in GrainPest were captured by dome cameras as shown in figure 1, It can be seen that the pest instances occupy only a small portion of the image. As the body length of stored-grain pests ranges from 1.2 to 4mm, detecting pests with body lengths of just millimeter level on the surface of grain bulks in a granary is considerably challenging.

## Diverse Appearances of Pest Instances
The rich biological behaviors of pests contributed to the diverse poses of the pest instances. In addition, due to different shooting angles and distances, the pest instances exhibit different degrees of deformation, further increasing the variety of pest instances. Figure 2 and figure 3 show the pest instances with different poses and the pest instances with different degrees of deformation, respectively. Besides, the chromatism of the pest images varies a lot due to the different settings of dome cameras and lighting conditions in granaries, as shown in figure 4. The diverse appearances enrich GrainPest and make it more suitable for developing pest detection algorithms for practice applications.
