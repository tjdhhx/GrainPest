# GrainPest
  GrainPest is an image dataset for stored-grain pest detection on the surface of grain bulks. It contains 16358 images, including six common species of stored-grain pest: Rusty grain beetle, Sawtoothed grain beetle, Lesser grain borer, Red flour beetle, Maize weevil, and Rice weevil. A total of 66372 pest instances with detection bounding boxes were annotated.  
  
## About GrainPest
 GrainPest is an image dataset for stored-grain pest detection on the surface of grain bulks. It contains 16358 images, including six common species of stored-grain pest: Rusty grain beetle, Sawtoothed grain beetle, Lesser grain borer, Red flour beetle, Maize weevil, and Rice weevil. A total of 66372 pest instances with detection bounding boxes were annotated. All the pest images were taken by dome cameras. Figure 1 shows the images of specimen pests of these six species of stored-grain pests.For more detail, please see [introduction for GrainPest](https://github.com/tjdhhx/GrainPest/blob/main/introduce/introduce.md) .

## Examples images of Grain Pest
Images in GrainPest were captured by dome cameras. It can be seen that the pest instances occupy only a small portion of the image. As the body length of stored-grain pests ranges from 1.2 to 4mm, detecting pests with body lengths of just millimeter level on the surface of grain bulks in a granary is considerably challenging. For more detail, please see [Example images](https://github.com/tjdhhx/GrainPest/blob/main/introduce/exampleimages.md) .
